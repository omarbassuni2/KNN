# KNN
The K-Nearest-Vector is an algorithm that search for nearest K-values and decides the class of the test data instace according to the majority of K-nearest output classes. Using Euclidean Distance.
# Problem
The dataset has 8 features and output column.
These features should decide what college the a data instance should go to according to the Euclidean Distance and K value.
The scope of this project is to implement KNN and show how choosing different K-values affect the accuracy of the model
